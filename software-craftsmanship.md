## Quotes 

> Being abstract is something profoundly different from being vague … The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.
> ~ Edsger W. Dijkstra

> Programming is a systematic design of abstractions and a systematic approach to human creativity
> ~ Jay McCarthy
